## Scope and epistemic status

This note records proof obligations visible from the source signatures and the BBMST paper mapping. It does not claim a disproof of the Erdős–Selfridge conjecture, nor does it establish prize eligibility. The current Lean file uses two explicit axioms for deep BBMST results; therefore the main theorem is not presently proved from Lean's kernel-checked derivations alone.

## Obligation matrix

| Lean item | Current role | Required mathematical obligation | Audit status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sieve_criterion` | Axiom: odd covering system plus `sieveSum < 1` implies False | Formalize the applicable BBMST exclusion criterion and all hypotheses needed for the chosen moment bounds | UNPROVED AXIOM |
| `sf_sieve_lt_one` | Axiom: for any finite list of odd primes, supplies `δs, ca1, ca3` with sieve sum < 1 | Formalize the square-free case / BBMST Theorem 1.1, including existence and validity of the initial distribution/moment constants | UNPROVED AXIOM |
| `δs` in `sf_sieve_lt_one` | Only elementwise `0 ≤ δ_i < 1` is required by its result; no explicit `δs.length = primes.length` | Prove parameter alignment or prove the sieve expression is valid for mismatched lists | GAP IN INTERFACE |
| `sieveTerm` | Uses `getD k 0`; rational division is totalized at denominator zero | Ensure valid inputs keep the intended denominator positive, or define the expression to reject invalid parameters | DEGENERACY RISK |
| `M2bound` | Uses numerator `c3 - 2*c1 + 1` | Match the exact hypotheses under which the strengthened second-moment estimate is valid | SOURCE-TO-CODE CHECK REQUIRED |
| Initial constants/distribution | `ca1` and `ca3` are existential outputs of an axiom | Derive them from the relevant distribution and prove the required moment inequalities; do not treat scalar inequalities alone as provenance | UNPROVED |
| Geometric hypothesis for stronger second-moment estimate | BBMST's stronger Eq. (13) is conditional on the stated geometric condition | Identify the exact object corresponding to the BBMST hyperplane family and prove the condition, or use the weaker valid bound | NOT YET MAPPED |

## Key distinction

A structure that stores length bounds and scalar inequalities can reject malformed inputs, but those fields are not themselves a proof that BBMST's moment estimates hold. The next mathematically meaningful change is not to add more scalar fields: it is to replace the relevant axiom(s) with theorems whose proof terms establish the estimates from the source hypotheses, and to trace all uses of the stronger Eq. (13) bound.

## Required next steps

1. Pin the exact BBMST definitions and theorem statements (including the supplement's initial-distribution construction).
2. Map every Lean quantity (`ss`, `δs`, `ca1`, `ca3`, `ck`, `M1bound`, `M2bound`) to the paper's notation.
3. Decide whether to formalize the LP/distribution existence argument or import a verified certificate with a proof of its validity.
4. Prove the geometric side condition wherever the stronger second-moment estimate is used, or replace that estimate with a weaker justified one and re-evaluate whether the numerical inequality still closes.
5. Re-run the transitive axiom trace on `erdos_selfridge`; any remaining project-specific axiom must be explicitly justified or eliminated before describing the result as a complete formal proof.

## Scope gate added 2026-10-28

Before translating Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4 into the current general odd-covering theorem, check the theorem's scope. The cited Balister–Bollobás–Morris–Sahasrabudhe–Tiba paper, *The Erdős–Selfridge problem with square-free moduli* (Algebra & Number Theory 15 (2021), 609–626), proves the obstruction for distinct square-free moduli. Its later remark on p. 625 gives a specific extension allowing nonsquare-free behavior at primes above 73; this is not, by itself, a theorem for arbitrary odd moduli without restrictions.

Consequently, the geometric interface
`fiber_second_moment_incidence`
is only an algebraic adapter. It does not establish that the paper's hyperplane model covers the `CoveringSystem K` object in the current theorem, nor that the paper's geometric hypotheses hold for every such object. Before attempting to discharge `sieve_criterion`, formalize and prove the exact bridge from the arithmetic covering-system representation to the finite product/hyperplane model, including the square-free or prime-exponent restrictions actually required. If the target remains the unrestricted odd-modulus Erdős–Selfridge conjecture, the cited paper alone does not discharge that gap.

Audit rule: do not identify Lemma 3.4's moment estimate with the current `M2bound` until the correspondence of measures, `alpha_k`, the hyperplane family, and the exact hypotheses has been proved. A numerical-looking match of formulas is insufficient.
