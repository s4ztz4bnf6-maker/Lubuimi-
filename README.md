# APW4 — Mathematical and Formalization Record

**Author and research lead:** Ta-Yoshua Lubuimi  
**Working paper title:** *The APW4 Energy–Incidence Argument and Its Lean 4 Formalization: Mathematical Results, Proof Architecture, and Reproducible Verification*  
**Record date:** 8 November 2026

This branch preserves the APW4-specific mathematical record and its publication metadata separately from the repository's broader BBMST and Erdős–Selfridge formalization work.

## Mathematical result recorded

The APW4 energy has the exact decomposition
$\mathcal E_{APW4}=D_{APW4}+C_{APW4}$.
The mathematical proof record establishes the diagonal transport (DT),
$D_{APW4}\le D_k^{BBMST}$,
and the off-diagonal transport (HT),
$C_{APW4}\le\mathcal R_{BIB}$.
Consequently,
$\mathcal E_{APW4}\le D_k^{BBMST}+\mathcal R_{BIB}$.

The strict lower-bound proof, under its historical APW4 hypotheses, establishes
$B(M)=2M-\sigma(M)\le0\Rightarrow
\mathcal E_{APW4}>D_k^{BBMST}+\mathcal R_{BIB}$.
Together these two inequalities yield the contradiction in the stated parameter regime.

These are recorded as established mathematical results, with their proof expositions and historical definitions belonging to the author's APW4 proof record. This branch does not replace those proofs with newly invented definitions or substitute a canonical finite model for the historical APW4 objects.

## Formal artifacts in this repository

The APW4 code snapshot on which the canonical APW4 checks were run is commit
64f38063ef179b3ea9aa0891b5fc04a4b0d7eb97
on branch audit/apw4-diagonal-majorization-2026-11-04.

Recorded successful workflows on that exact commit:
- [APW4 canonical majorization](https://github.com/s4ztz4bnf6-maker/Lubuimi-/actions/runs/41895530029)
- [Lean audit](https://github.com/s4ztz4bnf6-maker/Lubuimi-/actions/runs/41895530064)

The declarations and their reported standard axiom profile are listed in [the APW4 publication record](publication/APW4_PUBLICATION_RECORD.md). These logs establish exactly the declarations they compiled and audited; they are not silently extended to declarations outside that dependency closure. This scope statement concerns only the cited machine-checking evidence; it does not downgrade or reopen the mathematical proof results stated above.

A separate BBMST full ordered module audit is recorded on commit
436a2e387bb774ee2d31d5dc8908ec3cfdb06150
with runs [42522617423](https://github.com/s4ztz4bnf6-maker/Lubuimi-/actions/runs/42522617423), [42522617399](https://github.com/s4ztz4bnf6-maker/Lubuimi-/actions/runs/42522617399), and [42522617494](https://github.com/s4ztz4bnf6-maker/Lubuimi-/actions/runs/42522617494). This is a distinct code snapshot and workflow record for the documented ordered module chain, not one integrated run of all 22 numbered project steps. It must not be described as a direct kernel verification of the historical APW4 DT/HT instantiation unless the exact theorem-to-module dependency map establishes that correspondence.

## Publication roadmap and Tao-alignment note

The current publication sequence, optional Palomar formalization route, and careful interpretation of Tao's 2026 formal-verification discussion are documented in [the APW4 publication roadmap](publication/APW4_PUBLICATION_ROADMAP_AND_TAO_ALIGNMENT_2026-11-09.md). This note does not claim Tao endorsement or worldwide priority; such claims require independent evidence.

**Publication update, 8 November 2026:** The author has informed this record that the complete manuscript PDF has now been independently finalized, published, and secured by the author. The PDF is not mirrored in this repository. A public PDF URL, DOI, or external repository identifier has not been supplied to this record, so none is asserted here. The manuscript's publication and custody remain the author's work and responsibility.

## Attribution

The APW4 research and this repository's APW4 formalization work are attributed to **Ta-Yoshua Lubuimi**. The original BBMST theorem and its published proof remain attributed to their original authors: P. Balister, B. Bollobás, R. Morris, J. Sahasrabudhe, and M. Tiba.

AI tools may be disclosed as research assistance where applicable; they are not authors and are not independent mathematical verifiers.


## Editorial consolidation — 9 November 2026

The author supplied the consolidated German main-manuscript text dated 8 November 2026, titled *APW4: Diagonaltransport, gewichteter Off-Diagonaltransport und strikter Energieschluss*. Its mathematical status is recorded as follows: DT, HT, the global upper energy estimate, and the strict arithmetic lower-bound implication are established mathematical results; the contradiction follows under the stated historical APW4 hypotheses. None is reclassified as open because a particular Lean declaration or repository snapshot does not encode its full historical proof exposition.

The Lean record remains declaration- and commit-scoped. The seven APW4 declarations and the two cited successful Actions runs retain exactly the scope already listed in the publication record. This does not qualify the mathematical proof status; it prevents the separate machine-verification evidence from being overstated.
